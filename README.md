# SteamAccountChanger
a small bat file which allows you to quickly change accounts from one to another

once you have downloaded or copied `steam.bat`, you have to open it and change "AccountUsername" with the username of your account.
If you want to add more options, add the extra numbers to the end of `CHOICE /M Select /C 12`. for example: `CHOICE /M Select /C 1234`
